#Plugin indicator

##Introduction

This plugin allows you to manage a database of indicators with historical values.

History is managed in multiple schema (day, week, month).

An API ( `IndicatorFetcher` interface) defines the components loaded to update the indicator values.

These components are automatically detected from the time they are declared in a Spring context file.

A daemon calls at periodical interval these components.
